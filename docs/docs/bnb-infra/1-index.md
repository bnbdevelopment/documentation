# Welcome

This is the documentation and design of the private, hybrid architecture of BNBDEVELOPMENT, which houses all of our projects and platforms.

You can check the status of our hosted services in our [Status Page](https://status.bnbdevelopment.hu/)

## Baseline
The infastructure concists of two main parts:
- an **on-premise, self-hosted and managed** environment, where we operate all of our own hardware
- a **cloud based** environment, for ensuring high scalability and fault tolerance
## Version
Current version of the infrastructure: `v2.0`
:::warning
We are actively migrating over to the `v2.0` infrastructure. Service outages and interruptions are expected.
